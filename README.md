<h1>Store Project</h1>
The Store project is a RESTful web application built with .NET 6 and designed to provide a scalable, maintainable, and efficient backend for e-commerce or inventory management solutions. This application leverages a variety of modern development practices to ensure clean code architecture, enhanced performance, and robust data handling.

<h3>Key Features :</h3>
3-Layer Architecture: The project is structured into Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access layers, separating concerns and promoting modularity and scalability.

Repository Pattern: Centralizes and abstracts data access logic, making the application data-agnostic and easy to maintain or extend.

Generic Pattern: Provides reusable data handling methods across entities, promoting code reusability and reducing redundancy.

Data Seeding: Initial data is seeded to the database to provide out-of-the-box functionality and sample data for testing or demonstration purposes.

Pagination: Efficient pagination for large datasets, improving performance and providing a better user experience.

Identity Service: Implements user authentication and authorization, supporting secure access control and role-based permissions.

Specification Pattern: Allows complex querying and filtering logic, promoting clean, maintainable code for handling data queries.

Response Handling: Manages consistent API responses, including error handling and validation, to ensure a smooth client experience.
